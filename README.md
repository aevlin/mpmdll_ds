# üé∂ Music Playlist Management Using Doubly Linked List

This project is a simple C program for managing a music playlist using a doubly linked list. It allows users to add, remove, search, display, and shuffle songs, providing a straightforward way to organize music in a playlist structure.

## üìã Project Description

The **Music Playlist Management Using Doubly Linked List** program organizes songs with details including:
- **Title**
- **Artist**
- **Duration (in seconds)**

With a doubly linked list structure, this project supports dynamic and efficient operations on songs, making it easy to build and manage a playlist.

## üöÄ Features

- **Add a Song**: Insert a song into the playlist with its title, artist, and duration.
- **Remove a Song**: Remove a song by title.
- **Search for a Song**: Search for a song by title and view its details.
- **Display the Playlist**: Display all songs currently in the playlist.
- **Shuffle the Playlist**: Randomly shuffle and display the playlist order.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Each song is represented as a node in a doubly linked list. This allows efficient traversal in both directions, which is useful for flexible playlist management.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mpmdll_ds.git
   cd mpmdll_ds
   ```

2. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   gcc music.c -o music
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   ./music
   ```

4. **Menu Options**:
   The program provides a text-based menu for interacting with the playlist:
   - `1` - Add a song
   - `2` - Remove a song
   - `3` - Search for a song
   - `4` - Display the playlist
   - `5` - Shuffle the playlist
   - `6` - Exit

## üìÑ Code Overview

### Data Structure

The program defines a `Node` structure to represent each song:
```c
struct Node {
    char title[50];
    char artist[50];
    int duration;
    struct Node* prev;
    struct Node* next;
};
```

### Functions

- `addSong`: Adds a new song to the end of the playlist.
- `removeSong`: Removes a song by title if it exists.
- `searchSong`: Finds a song by title and displays its details.
- `displaySongs`: Displays all songs in the playlist in order.
- `shuffleSongs`: Randomly shuffles the playlist and displays the songs in shuffled order.

### Main Menu

The `main` function provides a menu interface that allows users to access each of these functions and manage the playlist interactively.
